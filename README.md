## changelog:

### Version 5.0
    - feat: added `tmux-extractwindow` script.
      (moves the currently active Window into its own, new Session)

### Version 4.0
    - bugfix: TMUX will now be launched in UTF-8 Mode.
      (fixes NerdFont rendering issues in certain Terminals)

    - bugfix: TMUX-Workspace will no longer try to reopen panels of a workspace,
      if that workspace is already open.

### Version 3.1
    - bugfix: When calling the command with the same session-name, as an existing one,
              the script would attach to the wrong session if it wasn't last in the list

    - bugfix: `-v` had no effect on the last created Window

    - bugfix: if the last opened window had multiple panes, they would not be evenly split (Issue #1)

### Version 3.0
    - windows are now created on the fly with the `-w windowname` parameter.
      (instead of being locked into only having 3 set windows)

### Version 2.0
    - moved from environment variables to command params for configuration

### Version 1.0
    - initial build
